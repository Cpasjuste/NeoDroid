Eli Gottlieb's checklist for the GSOC shaped windows project.  Dated July 9, 2010.
1. Enable proper linking of the X11 implementation and test it.
--> Find the place in the build system for platform-specific linking flags.  STATUS: DONE
--> Add a linker flag to bring in libXext.a. STATUS: DONE.
2. Build the Win32 implementation of shaped-windows functionality.
--> Add driver functions to the SDL_ShapeDriver in the Win32 driver's SDL_DisplayDevice at the proper point in the code.  STATUS: CHECK.
--> Add a hook in the Windows resize-window code to call Win32_ResizeWindowShape().  STATUS: CHECK.
--> Get the Windows code to build and run properly.  STATUS: IN PROGRESS.
3. Enable building the testeyes program.
--> Reprogram it to use the latest shaped-windows API.  STATUS: CHECK.
--> Get it, along with the rest of the test suite in my branch, building successfully.  STATUS: DONE.
--> Debug testeyes and the platform-specific shaped-window implementations in tandem.  STATUS: IN PROGRESS.
4. Implement the SDL shaped-windows API for Mac OS X using Cocoa.  STATUS: IN PROGRESS
--> Locate (once more) the API documentation for shaped windows under Cocoa.  STATUS: NEARLY FINISHED.
--> Design and encode a version of SDL_ShapeData for Cocoa.  STATUS: IN PROGRESS.
--> Write Cocoa_CreateShaper().  STATUS: MOSTLY DONE, AFAIK.
--> Write Cocoa_ResizeWindowShape().  STATUS: DONE, AFAIK.
--> Write Cocoa_SetWindowShape().  STATUS: IN PROGRESS.
--> If necessary, implement functionality adjunct to SDL_CalculateShapeBitmap() for Cocoa usage.
5. Use testeyes to debug all implementations. STATUS: SPRINT + 2.
--> Debug Cocoa implementation.
--> Debug Win32 implementation.
--> Debug X11 implementation (again).

1.3 release checklist:
 * http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/Roadmap

 * See why windows are being rearranged.  Is the shield window not up?
 * Make sure you can create and show a fullscreen window in one step
 * Figure out how to handle OpenGL context lost on Mac OS X (does it happen?)
 * Write automated test case for multi-draw APIs
 * Make sure you can build SDL without the renderer to slim it down a bunch
 * Implement assertion code on iPhone
 * Add __WINDOWS__ in addition to __WIN32__

 * Check 1.2 revisions:
	3554 - Need to resolve semantics for locking keys on different platforms
	4874 - Do we want screen rotation?  At what level?
	4974 - Windows file code needs to convert UTF-8 to Unicode, but we don't need to tap dance for Windows 95/98
	4484, 4485 - Verify that SDL's Windows keyboard handling works correctly
	4865 - See if this is still needed (mouse coordinate clamping)
	4866 - See if this is still needed (blocking window repositioning)
